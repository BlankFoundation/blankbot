## Enable Privileged Intent

For the bot to access members on a server, discord requires a "Privileged Intent" GUILD_MEMBERSHIP
You need enable it in the bot settings

## Add Dev Bot to Dev Server

Run this script and open the generated link in browser to add your bot

```
node addDevBot.js
```

## Generate Config File

Now that your dev bot is connected with your dev server, you can generate part of the config.js with this

```
node generateConfig.js
```

# Running tests

npm run test
